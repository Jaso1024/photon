# Simpler Approaches to Multi-PC Control

## Option 1: Use Official Sunshine Docker Image

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-official.yml up -d
```

This uses the official pre-built Sunshine image - no compilation needed!

## Option 2: Native Installation (Simplest)

### macOS
```bash
# Install Moonlight
brew install --cask moonlight

# On each remote PC, install Sunshine natively
# Download from: https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases
```

### Why Native Might Be Better
- No Docker complexity
- Better performance (no virtualization overhead)
- Easier GPU access
- Simpler networking

## Option 3: Existing Solutions

### 1. **Barrier** - Software KVM
```bash
brew install --cask barrier
```
- Control multiple PCs with one keyboard/mouse
- No video streaming needed if you have multiple monitors

### 2. **Synergy** - Commercial version of Barrier
- More polished, paid solution
- Better cross-platform support

### 3. **Jump Desktop** 
- macOS native app
- Supports multiple PCs
- Built-in switching

## Option 4: Simple Script-Based Approach

Create a simple launcher script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# moonlight-launcher.sh

case "$1" in
  1) moonlight stream 192.168.1.100 Desktop ;;
  2) moonlight stream 192.168.1.101 Desktop ;;
  3) moonlight stream 192.168.1.102 Desktop ;;
  *) echo "Usage: $0 [1-3]" ;;
esac
```

Then use keyboard shortcuts to launch:
- Cmd+1 → Connect to PC 1
- Cmd+2 → Connect to PC 2
- etc.

## Recommendation

For your use case, I'd recommend:

1. **Install Moonlight natively** on your Mac
2. **Install Sunshine natively** on each PC you want to control
3. **Use macOS keyboard shortcuts** or a simple script to switch between them

This avoids all the Docker complexity while achieving the same goal.
